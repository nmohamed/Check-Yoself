# Check Yourself
A Python program that checks your form when weight lifting using OpenCV. View our website at tinyurl.com/SDcheckyourself! **Disclaimer: Use Check Yourself at your own risk - we are not liable for any injuries that may occur.**

## Installation
For Check Yourself to work, you need to have **Python**, a **webcam**, **4 LED markers**, and the following libraries installed:
* OpenCV
* PyGame and time (optional)
* Numpy
* Math

## Getting it to work
To start using Check Yourself, it's necessary to have 4 LEDs - red, blue, green, and orange - that you can attach to yourself. If you're having problems with getting the LEDs to be recognized, you can change the parameters for the colors in line ---. If you don't have LEDs, you can use colored circles (make sure to change the parameters in lines ---), however, recognizing circles can be very finicky depending on the lighting of a room, the objects in a room, and the clothes you're wearing. More information on marker placement can be found by clicking the "Help" button while using our program. Make sure not to stand too close to your computer!
